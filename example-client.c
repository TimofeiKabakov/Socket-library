// This is a simple example of utilizing the library to implement a simple
// client. The client connects to a single server, whose information is given
// via the commandline. The client sends requests to the server, then blocks
// until it receives a response. The idea is that this simple example models a
// real-world use case where clients need to offload some very expensive
// computation onto a much more powerful server.
